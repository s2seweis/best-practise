## Styling
- In this approach, styles are imported as a module, and specific class names (styles.formContainer ...) are used for each element. 
- These class names are scoped to this component, ensuring they won't conflict with styles in other parts of your application.
- See Contact.js and Contact.css. 

## Eslint
1. For seeing the errors in the browser:
2. run npx eslint . = for showing the probs and errors in the console
3. run npx eslint . --fix (will show the props in the browser)
4. start working on a file

## Getting Started:

In your project directory, create a new file named .env. Inside this file, define your Firebase configuration variables without quotes or any special characters.

1.  Example .env file:

```
  REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your-api-key
  REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-auth-domain
  REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
  REACT_APP_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-storage-bucket
  REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your-messaging-sender-id
  REACT_APP_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your-app-id
```

2. Update Your Firebase Configuration File:
- Modify your Firebase configuration file to read the environment variables from the .env file.

```
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: process.env.REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY,
  authDomain: process.env.REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN,
  projectId: process.env.REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID,
  storageBucket: process.env.REACT_APP_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET,
  messagingSenderId: process.env.REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID,
  appId: process.env.REACT_APP_FIREBASE_APP_ID,
};
```

3. Install dependencies:

```
- npm install
```

4. To run the project locally, use the following command:

```
- npm start/ npm run start
```

## Best Practices

- **Folder Structure**: Organize your project files into meaningful directories such as `components`, `layouts`, `styles`, and `utils` for better code management.
- **Component Naming**: Use descriptive and concise names for your components. Follow naming conventions like PascalCase for components and camelCase for variables and functions.
- **State Management**: Utilize state management libraries like Redux or Context API for managing global states efficiently.
- **Error Handling**: Implement error boundaries and proper error handling techniques to enhance the user experience and make debugging easier.
- **Code Splitting**: Split your code into smaller chunks using React Lazy and Suspense to optimize loading times, especially for larger applications.
- **Responsive Design**: Design your components and layouts to be responsive using CSS media queries or responsive design frameworks like Bootstrap or Material-UI.
- **Testing**: Write unit tests and integration tests for your components and functions using testing libraries like Jest and React Testing Library.
- **Git Workflow**: Follow a consistent Git branching strategy (e.g., GitFlow) and write clear and descriptive commit messages.

## Components

Components form the building blocks of your React application. They encapsulate UI elements and functionality, making your code modular, reusable, and easy to maintain. In this project, you'll find a variety of components catering to different purposes. Each component follows best practices, ensuring clean and efficient code.

## Layouts

Layouts in this project are designed to provide a consistent and user-friendly experience across your React application. They offer a structured way to arrange components and content on the screen. Each layout comes with predefined styles and structure, allowing you to focus on building your application features.
